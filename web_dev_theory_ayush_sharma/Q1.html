<h1>1. Difference between Frontend, Backend, and Full-Stack Development</h1>
<p><strong>Frontend:</strong> It is the part of a website users interact with directly. It includes everything a user sees — like buttons, colors, text, and layout. Example: When you open <em>Amazon</em>, the product listings, search bar, and navigation menu are built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.</p>
<p><strong>Backend:</strong> It manages the logic, database, and server operations behind the scenes. For example, when you log in to Amazon, the backend verifies your credentials and fetches your order data. Technologies include Node.js, Python, PHP, etc.</p>
<p><strong>Full-Stack:</strong> A developer who works on both frontend and backend. Example: A developer who designs the Amazon UI and also handles server-side logic using Node.js and databases like MongoDB.</p>
