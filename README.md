# 🧮 Calculator Project

## 📘 Overview
This project is a simple **Calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It was created as part of a class activity to learn and apply **Flexbox layout**, **CSS styling techniques**, and **basic web interactivity** using JavaScript.

The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and features a clean and responsive design.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement **Flexbox** for layout design.  
- Apply various **CSS properties** for styling (colors, borders, spacing, alignment, etc.).  
- Build a **fully functional calculator** using HTML structure, CSS design, and JavaScript logic.  
- Practice organizing code for better readability and maintainability.

## 🧱 Features
- ➕ Addition  
- ➖ Subtraction  
- ✖️ Multiplication  
- ➗ Division  
- 🧹 Clear/Reset functionality  
- 🖥️ Responsive layout using Flexbox  
- 🎨 Styled with custom CSS (hover effects, borders, shadows, button styling)

---

## 🧩 Technologies Used
- **HTML5** – for structure  
- **CSS3** – for styling and layout (Flexbox + Media Queries)  

---

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The calculator layout is designed using **Flexbox** to align buttons and the display neatly.
2. JavaScript captures button clicks and performs the required calculations in real-time.  
3. The result is displayed dynamically on the calculator screen.  
4. The interface is now **responsive**, adapting automatically to various screen sizes.

## 📱 Responsive Design (📅 *November 3, 2025*)
Today, I worked on making the design **fully responsive** using **Flexbox** and **CSS media queries**.  
The updated design adjusts perfectly for desktops, tablets, and mobile screens.

### ✅ Enhancements:
- Optimized layout for **different screen sizes**  
- Dynamic **text and image scaling**  
- Balanced **gradients, spacing, and alignment**  
- Smooth **box-shadow transitions** for depth  
- Clean, **modern look** consistent across all devices
