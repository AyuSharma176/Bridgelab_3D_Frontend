# 🧮 Calculator Project

## 📘 Overview
This project is a simple **Calculator** built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.  
It was created as part of a class activity to learn and apply **Flexbox layout**, **CSS styling techniques**, and **basic web interactivity** using JavaScript.

The calculator performs basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division, and features a clean and responsive design.

## 🎯 Learning Objectives
- Understand and implement **Flexbox** for layout design.  
- Apply various **CSS properties** for styling (colors, borders, spacing, alignment, etc.).  
- Build a **fully functional calculator** using HTML structure, CSS design, and JavaScript logic.  
- Practice organizing code for better readability and maintainability.

## 🛠️ How It Works
1. The calculator layout is designed using **Flexbox** to align buttons and the display neatly.  
2. Each button is styled with CSS for consistent sizing and hover effects.  
3. JavaScript captures button clicks and performs the required calculations in real-time.  
4. The result is displayed dynamically on the calculator screen.
